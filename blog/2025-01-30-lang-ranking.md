My personal ranking of programming languages, just because I feel like it

### The winner - Scala

Anyone that knows me well, knows that I rank Scala as the best, most enjoyable language to write software code.

The flexibility it provides (from more "Java-like" structure to pure functional code), and the expressiveness of the 
language (pattern matching, higher-order functions), I feel I can both write and understand the code with ease.

I also love SBT (Build Tool) and all the features it provides, I feel a productive developer when building applications in Scala.

I understand and respect the criticism on the steep learning curve it requires. 
But personally I would rather invest on climbing that learning curve and have a more solid and maintainable application 
than pay the price of developing on another language and have bugs, runtime exceptions and/or poor maintainability 
down the road.

### Strong seconds - Kotlin, Java, Crystal, Rust

I had the chance at some point of my life to try these programming languages and I had a good experience about all of them.

Kotlin felt to me a "better Java", not excessive boilerplate code, I could quickly understand and become productive on a new repository.

Crystal lang is not widely used but, for my sandbox projects, I enjoyed the simplicity and performance of this language.

Finally, Rust. I definitely need more experience with the language, but I enjoyed the language features, 
didn't feel too hard to start developing on Rust.

### Not my cup of tea - Go and Python

I have used in the past both Go and Python, and can't say it was a positive experience.

With Go, I struggled with libraries dependency management as well as the lack of generics and advanced features. Always
felt I had to write a lot of code to do some simple operations.

With Python, I struggled with runtime bugs simply because of no type checking and what felt to me a poor testing setup.
On top of all known criticisms of the language (such as poor performance and scaling issues), I would not use Python 
on a live production application.
