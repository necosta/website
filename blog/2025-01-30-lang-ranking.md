My personal ranking of programming languages 

<!-- truncate -->

### The winner - Scala

Anyone that knows me well, knows that I rank Scala as the best, most enjoyable language to write software code.

The flexibility it provides (from more "Java-like" structure to pure functional code), and the expressiveness of the 
language (pattern matching, higher-order functions), I feel I can both write and understand the code with ease.

I understand and respect the criticism on the steep learning curve it requires. 
But personally I would rather invest on climbing that learning curve and have a more solid and maintainable application 
than pay the price of developing on another language and have bugs, runtime exceptions and/or poor maintainability 
down the road.
