Life as a consultant was different back then. \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nI remember joining in Nov08 and having as a first challenge a data migration project with a very tight deadline (had to go live\\nJanuary first). The migration was configured on SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) and involved moving all data from \\nclient database A to a generic SAP database B.\\n\\nAs a junior Data Engineer I quickly had to improve my very basic university SQL knowledge to contribute to this project \\nas well as learn ways of testing and validating the ETL.\\n\\nThe migration was a success so 2009 started with new responsibilities.\\n\\nFor that same client, I started working on evolving their SSAS (SQL Server Analytical Services) OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) solution.\\nAlso known as a data warehouse, I built SQL and MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) queries, also taking tasks on \\nSSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) building reports for client analysts to access. \\nDuring 2009 and 2010 I had my first go as a software developer. The client application was built on VB.NET (Visual Basic) and \\nthere I performed my first code changes, mainly bug fixes.\\nCode was versioned controlled on SVN (Subversion), since then I always used Git.\\n\\nI was lucky to have worked on a team of such smart individuals that fostered a supportive environment for my first steps.\\nAnd special mention to lunch hour, we worked hard in the office but lunchtime was sacred, we all went together to this\\nspecial hidden gem of a restaurant where food was beyond delicious. \ud83e\udd24\\n\\n### Quantium - Sydney\\n\\nAfter two years working in Lisbon, I decided to live and work in the country that I was born and was always curious to go \\n(I left Australia when I was six years old). I didn\'t go to Australia with a job already locked, I decided to start \\nlooking for one once I arrived, and I was fortunate that [Quantium](http://www.quantium.com/) believed in my strengths \\nand employed me only three weeks after my arrival.\\n\\nThe environment I found was of a startup, this is, a small group of developers working with ambition and excitement, \\nand very proud of their work.\\n\\nI started working on a product for an Australian industrial gas company, that enabled account managers to go into rural \\nareas without internet and obtain the RSP (recommended sales price) for their customers based on factors such as quantity and \\ndistance (a lot of actuarial work was put in the RSP).\\nIt was developed on C#, I took responsibilities mainly at a database level, building SQL views and stored procedures \\non a MSSQL Server database. Interestingly enough, despite English not being my first language, I quickly also took responsibilities \\non on-call support, being on the phone with account managers faced with the occasional issue on the app.\\n\\nThe number of developers was small (around 25) and we had a very relaxed environment between us and the rest of the company.\\nI felt welcomed and worked hard to deliver quality work on SQL side while also learning how to develop on C#.\\n\\nIt was on my second year of that project that the company got investment to build a v2 app for the global market.\\nThe team immediately grew and I spent the next two years working both on SQL and C# integrating each market SAP databases \\nand models into a unified global database.\\n\\nIf my memory is accurate, we integrated at least 8 markets, providing RSP and other features, on industrial gas, delivery, handling and safety equipment.\\nDuring those years I got much more proficient programming on C#, keeping my main role on SQL and data engineering.\\n\\nThis company marked my professional life in so many ways. The \\"Australian way\\" of working hard with ambition but with \\nwork-life balance, the beautiful office with a view to the Sydney bridge and Opera House, the football lunch breaks on\\nthe botanical gardens, I keep vivid good memories of my time there.\\n\\nAround 2014, after four years working in the industrial gas industry, I changed scope and landed within the same company \\nin Media. I worked on three ETL projects, doing customer segmentation and there I got a first taste of big data, machine learning\\nand Scala.\\n\\nWith an \\"in-house\\" big data cluster, you could hear the \\"roar\\" from the server room as data stored in HDFS (Hadoop File System),\\nprocessed with Hadoop MapReduce (then Apache Spark), and orchestrated with Apache Mesos provided the output. \\nWorking with very smart data scientists, I started understanding ML concepts like supervised learning and GBT (Gradient Boosted Trees).\\n\\nI was again lucky to start at an early stage working with Scala, Spark (which was still on unstable v1.4) and Machine Learning.\\nI worked for more than one year on this exciting and new Big Data world before making the hard decision to go back to Portugal.\\n\\n### Nokia - Lisbon\\n\\nI arrived back to Portugal on the summer of 2016. \\nI wasn\'t thinking looking straight away for a new opportunity, I took some time off, I watched Portugal win the Euro2016 \\nfootball championship and I did a Euro trip, visiting seven countries that summer.\\nI was also looking into ideas to open my own company, but I was unsuccessful in that regard.\\n\\nTherefore, I started applying to new job offers and in January 2017 I started as a Big Data Engineer at [Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/).\\nThe project was an interesting one, build a PaaS (Platform as a Service) integrating open-source tools into a unified suite.\\n\\nThis project had its own challenges, not necessarily creating business logic but integrating components from Keycloak (IAM solution), \\nApache Zeppelin (Notebooks for data analysis), Kong (API gateway), Cassandra (NoSQL database), etc., into a seamless suite. \\nWe used Scala as the main language for integration, load and smoke tests. \\nI was able to develop my skills in this language, specially because I was in luck for being able to work with one \\nof the best Scala developers I have met. He opened my perspective on so many aspects from architecture/design to open-source and community.\\n\\nI was also able to travel, going twice to Finland (once in summer witnessing midnight sunsets, once in winter witnessing snow and 3pm sunsets) \\nand once to India (an incredible experience).\\n\\nDespite my role as Big Data Engineer, I was more and more working on software development and less on databases, also contributing\\non open source projects, and therefore started looking for a new challenge where I could have more impact as a developer.\\n\\n### tb.lx by Daimler Trucks - Lisbon\\n\\nThat exciting opportunity finally arrived in November 2018 where I was able to be part of the initial team of [tb.lx](https://www.tblx.io/), \\na startup within the corporate, built to expedite software development for Daimler Trucks and Buses.\\n\\nIt was exciting because day one we were assembling IKEA furniture, waiting for our laptops to arrive. \\nBeing a small group, team dynamics were great. We had data scientists and developers with a \\"green field\\" to explore\\nwhat could be done with such a huge amount of telemetry data coming out of trucks and buses.\\n\\nGiven my acquired experience, I defined best practices and processes within the company. From defining our artifactory server\\nto code reviews, interviewing new candidates, etc. I took a wide role and responsibilities.\\n\\nI was also able to travel, going several times to Germany and once to the USA.\\nOn a more technical level, microservices were built mainly in JVM languages (Scala was not enforced, opening the door \\nfor Kotlin and Java), managed in Kubernetes and deployed in Azure.\\n\\nI worked with a variety of processing tools, from Apache Kafka to Apache Flink, also Apache Spark, delivering interesting \\nbusiness value for fleet managers from eco-drive feedback, trip segmentation, etc.\\n\\nIf it was not the global pandemic of 2020 I would be perhaps still be working there, as I met some of the most wonderful people\\nwhen I was there. But life had other plans for me...\\n\\n### 47 degrees (now Xebia Functional) - San Fernando / Seville\\n\\nAs for almost everyone, March 2020 brought a big change to our lives. From going to the office, we were now working from \\nhome waiting for an end to the disruption. It made us reflect on our purpose and, for me, it was the time I built a deep\\nrelationship with who is now my wife and partner in life.\\n\\nWe took the decision to move to Spain in November 2021. I joined a company named 47 degrees (bought by [Xebia](https://xebia.com/) in 2022) \\nthat was under my radar for a long time, a company expert on Scala and Functional programming, \\nan area that always fascinated me but that I never had practical experience.\\n\\nI did not regret it. I met such nice, welcoming and kind people and I encountered a work environment that allowed me to \\nlearn and grow so much in such few years.\\n\\nI initially started on a project for a Japanese fintech company. Heavy using Scala Cats and Http4s libraries, running on GCP,\\nI wasn\'t on my comfort zone, but I quickly got up to speed with the fast pace of the project. \\n\\nIt was only a 6 months project, but I really enjoyed it and I treasure it as one of the best projects I worked for (worked \\nwith really talented developers there). \\n\\nI then moved to a UK project on collecting and processing telemetry data, this time from cars. \\nI had some previous experience but the technologies used were different as well as the focus. The main objectives was \\nensuring data normalisation and validation. I often had a \\"dev-ops\\" hat, on infrastructure concerns, \\nrather than software development.\\n\\nAfter one year in this project, I joined a US client with an ambitious project requiring a huge team of developers, \\nrebuilding a data streaming platform for online radio streaming. \\nUsing Scala Cats and typelevel stack (http4s, circe, feral, ...), and with a tight deadline, \\nwe delivered successfully the new platform.\\nI feel I improved in so many different aspects in this project, from specification to API definition, tests and deployment, \\nI definitely feel I grew once again as an engineer.\\n\\n2024 was a year of change with the birth of my daughter, definitely changing my perspective of life.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor now, this is all I got. Hope you enjoyed it. \ud83d\ude0a"}]}}')}}]);
