# AI and ML

A deep-dive into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

Model trained using labeled data, meaning each input comes with a corresponding correct output

Examples:
- Classification: Predicting categories (e.g., spam detection in emails, image recognition)
- Regression: Predicting continuous values (e.g., stock price prediction, house price estimation)

Goal is to predict outcomes

### Unsupervised Learning

Model trained on data without labeled outputs.
It tries to find patterns, structures, or relationships within the data

Examples:
- Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation, anomaly detection)
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of variables in the dataset while preserving information (e.g., PCA for feature selection)

Goal is to find patterns

## Artificial Intelligence

- LLM (Large Language Models)
  - Category of AI models that are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
  - A type of LLM:
    - Generative: It can create new text based on input prompts
    - Pre-trained: It learns from a large corpus of text before being fine-tuned for specific use cases
    - Transformer-based: Uses self-attention mechanisms to process words in context efficiently
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
  - Data Retrieval - Knowledge graph or database
  - Augmentation - Feeds data into generative model, reducing hallucinations
  - Generation - Synthesizes info. into coherent, context-aware output
  - **Goals:** Accuracy and Clarity
