# AI and ML

A deep-dive into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Artificial Intelligence

- LLM (Large Language Models)
  - Category of AI models that are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
  - A type of LLM:
    - Generative: It can create new text based on input prompts
    - Pre-trained: It learns from a large corpus of text before being fine-tuned for specific use cases
    - Transformer-based: Uses self-attention mechanisms to process words in context efficiently
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
  - Data Retrieval - Knowledge graph or database
  - Augmentation - Feeds data into generative model, reducing hallucinations
  - Generation - Synthesizes info. into coherent, context-aware output
  - **Goals:** Accuracy and Clarity
