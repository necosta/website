# Repositories

What to take in consideration when building an application

Aspects:

- [Source code](repositories#source-code)
- [Tests](repositories#tests)
- [Documentation](repositories#documentation)
- [CI/CD](repositories#cicd)
- [Observability](repositories#observability)
- [Performance](repositories#performance)
- [Cost](repositories#cost)
- [Security](repositories#security)
- [Infrastructure](repositories#infrastructure)

## Source code

* SOLID Principles: Modular, scalable and maintainable code
  * S - Single-responsibility Principle
  * O - Open-closed Principle
  * L - Liskov Substitution Principle
  * I - Interface Segregation Principle
  * D - Dependency Inversion Principle  
* DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid duplication by abstracting reusable logic
* KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Write simple, easy-to-understand code
* YAGNI (You Ain’t Gonna Need It): Avoid premature optimizations and unnecessary features

## Tests

* Unit tests
* Integration tests
* Load tests
* E2E tests
* Golden tests

## Documentation

* README - How to section
* API usage

## CI/CD

  * Pipeline configuration

## Observability

* Logging - Recording events, messages, or errors, critical for debugging, monitoring, and auditing
* Tracing - Tracking the flow of requests through distributed systems
* Profiling – Capturing CPU/memory usage patterns in real time
* Metrics - Quantifiable data points about system health and performance
* Alerting – Setting up notifications for anomalies or predefined thresholds
* Visualization & Dashboards – Aggregating and presenting observability data

## Performance

* TBD

## Cost

* Running costs 

## Security

* TBD 

## Infrastructure

* IaC
* Scalability
* Zero-downtime deployment
* Components - Databases, cache, ...
