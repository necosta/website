# Scala

A guide on Scala main features:

- **Higher-Order Functions:** Functions can be passed as arguments or returned
- **Extensions:** Extension methods, add methods to existing types without modifying them
- **Pattern Matching:** Expressive matching mechanism, including collections
- **Given/Using:** Dependency injection-like behavior
- **Opaque types:** Strong type aliases
- **Union Types:** Compose/allow different types
- **Inline Functions:** Compile-time optimizations by replacing function calls with their definitions
